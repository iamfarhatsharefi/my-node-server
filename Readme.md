# Simple Node.js Server

## Description

A basic and responsive Node.js server application built using **Express.js**. This project demonstrates CRUD operations on user data, serves static HTML and CSS files, and handles various HTTP requests. Itâ€™s designed to provide a clean and professional API with basic error handling, routing, and static content serving.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Serves a static homepage (`index.html`) with basic information.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for user data through API routes.
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - `GET /users`: Retrieve a list of users.
  - `POST /users`: Add a new user.
  - `PUT /users/:id`: Update a specific user.
  - `DELETE /users/:id`: Delete a specific user.
- **Responsive Design**: Static files (HTML, CSS) are served for basic front-end interaction, ensuring the pages display well across devices.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented for invalid routes and methods.
- **Express Router**: Organized routes using Express Router for clean code structure.
- **Static Files**: Serves static files like HTML and CSS from the `public/` directory.
